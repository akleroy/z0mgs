ORPHAN GALAXIES

A few (~20) catalog entries have no corresponding galbase entry. My
searches suggest that this is because some of them are not objtype
galaxy in LEDA and in a few other cases we may simply have been bit by
LEDA versions. Some are galaxy pairs, etc.

To see these, print_missing_from_galbase.pro
